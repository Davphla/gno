# Why Wendored /p/ packages ?

NOTE: files are vendored here i.e. coppied from upstream app
gnodev does support multiple paths for .gno source discovery

It's imagined users will only want to keep copies of the packages they actually use.
This allows the gnoserve directory to be hosted as a stand-alone app more easily.
